## Your anti-cheat and your bans
This is a 2 in one plugin

So many things that an anti-cheat does, this plugin does for you. Even more!

Anti-cheats only stop hackers. This functionality is not built in; however, in BetterBans, it alerts players with permission of the hacking and the hacks used. In addition, if you want, you can configure BetterBans to ban the player after suspected hacks for the correct length. This is something your anti-cheat probably does not do.

### Anti-cheat functions
