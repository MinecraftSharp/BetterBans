## Your anti-cheat and your punishment
This is a 2 in one plugin

So many things that an anti-cheat does, this plugin does for you. Even more!

Anti-cheats only stop hackers. This functionality is not built in; however, in BetterBans, it alerts players with permission of the hacking and the hacks used. In addition, if you want, you can configure BetterBans to ban the player after suspected hacks for the correct length. This is something your anti-cheat probably does not do.

### Anti-cheat functions
 - AntiXray
 - AntiKillAura
 - AntiGrief (Must interact with blocks naturally)
 - AntiSpam
 - NoSpeed
 - NoFly
 - NoClip
 - NoFastEat
 
## Easy Ban
Sometimes ban lengths are hard to remember. This plugin solves this with the ban length built in. Moderators, admins and owners only need to select the ban length. If you want to implement increasing ban lengths, BetterBans can do that for you.

Want to specify a custom length (in hours or days or months). Just select the custom ban (commandBlocks)

This is the panel shown when /ban is run
![Custom Length](https://i.imgur.com/TqbuYtl.png)
This is only shown if a custom ban is selected. In this case the "custom (month)" was selected

This is shown at the end, and lets you pick if you want to IP-Ban the player or just ban the UUID

## Online management
Joining the server just to ban or unban a player is difficult. Use the webUI to ban or unban a player. Want to punishments to be public? The webUI can show this to players.

## GhostPlugin
Hide this plugin from users. All commands can be hidden, ban messages can be custimized to be generic, or the BetterBans ban message can be used.

## BanWave
For minigame servers, you may want to ban players in waves to make it more difficult for which hacks are detected. There are multiple modes (time, player threashold).
